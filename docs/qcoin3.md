How has bitcoin evolved, what if I want to create tokens on the bitcoin blockchain?
You said:
what if I want something post quantum safe?
You said:
Slow down, I'm not insisting on Bitcoin, since what you've just said is Bitcoin will not be resilient in an age of quantum computing, so let's revisit the entire concept, how about we build Quantcoin?
You said:
Yes I want Quantcoin primarily as a reserve asset and token platform for games

Let's prepare instructions for Codex, we're going to build this in Rust, let's break the instructions up into discrete steps which can be pasted individually as prompts to Codex.
You said:
actually first off, let's change the name from quantcoin to qcoin (it's simpler, faster to type, and won't cause confusion whether this is mathematician oriented). I've already created the public repo on Github: jaylauffer/qcoin and I've set this with MIT License. Please rewrite the 12 Codex instruction prompts using the qcoin name.
You said:
Okay, this prompts have been run thorugh Codex and merged into jaylauffer/qcoin main, please review the current main of jaylauffer/qcoin and let's discuss next steps.

This is a public repo, check here: https://github.com/jaylauffer/qcoin

Let's take a step back and discuss reality of blockchain operations, qcoin requires a peer based node network, what is the viable liquidity needed to sustain the chain?

Help me to understand, Proof of Stake is more energy efficient compared to Proof of Work, however does the cost to attack < cost to defend hold true for both? What are the nuances here?
You said:
Pause just a moment, because PoS also has a physical cost, it takes energy for both solutions, so what's the ratio/delta between PoS energy consumption and PoW energy consumption, and finally are these the only choices or can we open our thinking to a broader box (maybe beyond the box)?
You said:
Help me understand about validator elections, to my understanding within a node pool this is a way to grant authoritative decision making to a node, which the other nodes with then accept, of course obviously malicious nodes might refuse to accept and act disruptively or even fragment the pool.
You said:
Let's discuss Post Quantum VRFs, since this would be a necessary component if we utilize PoT in our solution. What can we ascertain about VRFs in a quantum computing world?
You said:
Additionally what about PQ VDFs?
