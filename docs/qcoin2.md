# QCOIN Branch 2: Development Roadmap and Consensus Questions

_This branch continues after the shared context in `qcoin0.md`._

1. **Let's prepare instructions for Codex, we're going to build this in Rust, let's break the instructions up into discrete steps which can be pasted individually as prompts to Codex.**

2. **actually first off, let's change the name from quantcoin to qcoin (it's simpler, faster to type, and won't cause confusion whether this is mathematician oriented). I've already created the public repo on Github: jaylauffer/qcoin and I've set this with MIT License. Please rewrite the 12 Codex instruction prompts using the qcoin name.**

3. **Okay, this prompts have been run thorugh Codex and merged into jaylauffer/qcoin main, please review the current main of jaylauffer/qcoin and let's discuss next steps.**

6. **Let's take a step back and discuss reality of blockchain operations, qcoin requires a peer based node network, what is the viable liquidity needed to sustain the chain?**
   > You said:
7. **Help me to understand, Proof of Stake is more energy efficient compared to Proof of Work, however does the cost to attack < cost to defend hold true for both? What are the nuances here?**
   > You said:
8. **Pause just a moment, because PoS also has a physical cost, it takes energy for both solutions, so what's the ratio/delta between PoS energy consumption and PoW energy consumption, and finally are these the only choices or can we open our thinking to a broader box (maybe beyond the box)?**
   > You said:
9. **Explain to me these acronyms, VDF, BFT, and help me understand more about Proof of Burn?**
   > You said:
10. **I'm still eager to explore Proof of Liquidity and Proof of Useful Gaming, and I want to Understand with a VDF Proof of Time, does this mean certain transactions will have a maximum frequency?**
    > You said:
11. **Okay, so to be clear block generation has a determined max frequency due to VDF, which means it has a variable size, however many transactions happen within that period, and for further clarity, what are the scenarios where a block needs to be complete and validated for subsequent actions to be taken, e.g. I mint an asset do I need the block to be verified on chain before I sell/trade it to another?**
    > You said:
12. **We need to slow down again, confirmation/finality steps introduce complexity and compute overhead and potentially distance us from adopters.**
    > You said:

**How are these techniques combined or folded into the least amount of compute while still retaining all their qualities?**

13. **I need to know about epochs, these appear to be "planned" events on the chain that happen according to some form of schedule, given the inclination to utilize PQ-VDFs (or the best known quantum resilient solutions we currently have) which creates a "block pace" then I'm inclined to set the epoch at a fixed block interval, help me understand the purpose and nature of epochs, to what degree might the QCOIN chain customize/innovate within our epochs?**
    > You said:
14. **So here are some things I'm interested in, 1) since ownership requires block completion, I want block completion to happen quickly, I'm trying to understand how latency/network traversal factors into this, peer based networks will of course have minimum viable transaction times based on network traversal time.**
    > You said:
15. **If we operate these nodes on a quantum network what can we achieve?**
    > You said:
16. **Will you reconcile the various branches of this chat and provide a fully merged summary that I can utilize the kickstart a new chat?**
