How has bitcoin evolved, what if I want to create tokens on the bitcoin blockchain?

what if I want something post quantum safe?

Slow down, I'm not insisting on Bitcoin, since what you've just said is Bitcoin will not be resilient in an age of quantum computing, so let's revisit the entire concept, how about we build Quantcoin?
You said:
Yes I want Quantcoin primarily as a reserve asset and token platform for games

Are you able to search and review jaylauffer/qcoin either through the connector or via the public url: https://github.com/jaylauffer/qcoin

Let's wait and hope that whatever replication mechanism is in play replicates the repo to nodes which you may access. While we're waiting, I want to understand something: ledger size and the necessary storage a node requires to operate over time?

Actually I've decided to name the coin QCOIN to avoid confusion with the finance industry "quants", and I would like to formalize the Data Model and Storage Specification, however I think it's important to decide the actual Proof strategy first, which I'm still exploring in branched chats. I need a way to reconcile the various branches of this chat, what is a way to accomplish that?
