This is Jay, I'd like Billy Bethea MD to be my personal doctor, if any of you out there know him, please ask kindly if he might schedule me in.

I'm making this public with all the wrong reasons "best intentions" and I count on support you will continue to contribute.

There are a bunch of GPT Chats and I will try to get them here, so that this makes some sort of sense.

Earnest thanks for your interest.
