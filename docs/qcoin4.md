How has bitcoin evolved, what if I want to create tokens on the bitcoin blockchain?
You said:
what if I want something post quantum safe?
You said:
Slow down, I'm not insisting on Bitcoin, since what you've just said is Bitcoin will not be resilient in an age of quantum computing, so let's revisit the entire concept, how about we build Quantcoin?
You said:
Yes I want Quantcoin primarily as a reserve asset and token platform for games

Let's prepare instructions for Codex, we're going to build this in Rust, let's break the instructions up into discrete steps which can be pasted individually as prompts to Codex.
You said:
actually first off, let's change the name from quantcoin to qcoin (it's simpler, faster to type, and won't cause confusion whether this is mathematician oriented). I've already created the public repo on Github: jaylauffer/qcoin and I've set this with MIT License. Please rewrite the 12 Codex instruction prompts using the qcoin name.
You said:
Okay, this prompts have been run thorugh Codex and merged into jaylauffer/qcoin main, please review the current main of jaylauffer/qcoin and let's discuss next steps.

This is a public repo, check here: https://github.com/jaylauffer/qcoin

Let's take a step back and discuss reality of blockchain operations, qcoin requires a peer based node network, what is the viable liquidity needed to sustain the chain?
You said:
I've made this an opensource project under MIT license, there's nothing to prevent wealthy agents from grabbing this up and launching their own solution.
